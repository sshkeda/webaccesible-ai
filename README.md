waccessible.ai is an open-source project created by Stephen Shkeda to harness the capabilities of AI to increase web accessibility throughout the internet.

The waccessible.ai Extension is a Chrome [MV3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate)
extension that allows users to run an [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) accessibility test on a website and then chat about the accessibility violations with a [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps) AI chatbot.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
